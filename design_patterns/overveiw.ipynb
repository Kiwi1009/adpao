    "The information stored in the LLM weights is (usually) **not enough** to give accurate and insightful answers to our questions\n",

    "That's why we need to provide the LLM with ways to access the outside world 🌍\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you can build tools for whatever you want (at the end of the day they are just functions the LLM can use), from a tool that let's you access Wikipedia, another to analyse the content of YouTube videos or calculate difficult integrals in Wolfram Alpha.\n",

    "i.e. deciding what sequence of steps to follow to accomplish a large task?\n",
    "\n",
    "That is exactly what the Planning Pattern provides; ways for the LLM to break a task into **smaller, more easily accomplished subgoals** without losing track of the end goal.\n",
